Since arriving at Yale in 2012 as the Shizuo Kakutani Lecturer in Mathematics,
Dr. Rolf has been dedicated to finding creative, evidence-based ways for
students to learn mathematics and to support other educators in this same
endeavor. Dr. Rolf has transformed an introductory mathematics course, Calculus
115, by taking advantage of online tools and interactive technology to
encourage concept engagement and development of problem solving skills.
Building upon a platform developed by Coursera, he has crerated a “flipped
classroom” approach, developing 42 videos and associated preparatory
problems that students complete before coming to class. In addition to his
teaching responsibilities, Dr. Rolf has maintained an active research program.
Early in his career, he focused on numerical analysis; his current work is in
the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning. Recognized as an authority in technology
enhanced education, Dr. Rolf has been invited to lecture at numerous
academic institutions and conferences. Most recently, he co-authored Explorations
in Complex Analysis, a textbool with accompanying online tools for
concept exploration.<br><br>
After earning his Bachelor’s degree from Baylor University in Mathematics with
a minor in Russian, Dr. Rolf obtained a Master of Divinity degree from Southwestern
Seminary. He completed his Ph.D. at Duke University before being
appointed as an Assistant Professor at the United States Military Academy at
West Point in 1997. There, he received the Commander’s Award for Civilian
Service for outstanding achievements in faculty development and research
performance. In 2000, Dr. Rolf joined the faculty at the United States Air Force
Academy, where he initiated and coordinated implementation of technology-
based pedagogy into both introductory and advanced mathematics courses.
Dr. Rolf and his wife Ann have two children, James and Julia. In addition to
thinking about how to help undergraduates learn mathematics, he enjoys cycling,
woodworking, and gardening.

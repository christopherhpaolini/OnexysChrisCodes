	<div class="coach_name fullwelcome left">Welcome to the ONEXYS!</div>
	We're excited that you have chosen to be a part of the ONEXYS (Online Experiences for Yale Scholars) community!<br><br>

<strong>ONEXYS is not just about the math.</strong> Sure, you are going to be watching math videos, confirming this by taking a quiz, and doing some harder applications. But it's more than that.<br><br>

<strong>It's also about connections.</strong> Yup. connections. We want you to talk. And talk some more. And even more! You will be part of a team with a coach who will work with you through this experience. So talk! Talk to your coach. Talk to fellow ONEXians. Talk to yourself (ok, maybe not). Use the discussion boards. Make a commitment to video conference with your team at least twice a week. You will find that in order to succeed at Yale, you will need to collaborate well. And this is the first step in that process.<br><Br>

<strong>It's not about a grade.</strong> In fact there are no grades for this course. Yes, you are going practice and take quizzes. But you won't get a grade. But here's what you will get: feedback in the form of points and badges. Each time you do things helpful to your learning (practice take an application quiz, help someone on your team, login to Canvas several days in a row) you will be awarded some points. And when you get enough, these translate into badges.<br><br>

<strong>Our ONEXYS coaches rock.</strong> We've hired some amazing coaches this year. They are other undergrads who are a step or two down the road from you. So they know what to do (and not do!) to survive at Yale. Ask them about math. Ask them about the Buttery. Ask them about going to office hours. Ask them about anything you have questions about. You will be getting together with them at least twice a week. We think that you will find your coach will be invaluable in helping you get a head start for Yale.<br><br>

<stong>Finish the race.</strong> Check out the "Completing ONEXYS" tab to see what we're expecting you to do this summer to finish ONEXYS. We're going to celebrate all of you who finish in September with lots and lots of great food with Dean Holloway and Dean Quinlan.

Since we don't give formal grades in ONEXYS, we want to let you know what we expect you to do in order to complete the course.  And for those how complete ONEXYS, we're going to have a special event in September just for you. First, we're going to feed you a great meal. Second, we've invited Dean Jonathan Holloway and Dean Jeremiah Quinlan to join us in recognizing what you've done.<br><br>

<strong>Finish Line.</strong> In order to complete ONEXYS, you will need to:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Attempt the pre-Test (i.e. the chapter 0 Diagnostic). You've already done this!</li>
<li>Attempt the post-Test after ONEXYS concludes.</li>
<li>Attempt 80% of all the applications There are 10 total, so you do the math!</li>
<li>Achieve 70% proficiency on all chapters on the Orion Study &amp; Practice page.</li>
</ul><br>

<strong>Progress Bar.</strong> In order to help you cross this finish line, we are providing a progress bar at the top of your home page. Every time you log in, it will show you where you stand in the course.<br><br>

<strong>Badges.</strong>  Badges are our way of incentivizing things that we think will contribute to your learning. Each time you log in, you will see your latest earned badges on your home page. But go here to see all possible badges and some hints concerning what you can do to earn these.

	<div class="coach_name left">Professor Rolf</div>
	<div class="coach_bio">
Since arriving at Yale in 2012 as the Shizuo Kakutani Lecturer in Mathematics,
Dr. Rolf has been dedicated to finding creative, evidence-based ways for
students to learn mathematics and to support other educators in this same
endeavor. Dr. Rolf has transformed an introductory mathematics course, Calculus
115, by taking advantage of online tools and interactive technology to
encourage concept engagement and development of problem solving skills.
Building upon a platform developed by Coursera, he has crerated a “flipped
classroom” approach, developing 42 videos and associated preparatory
problems that students complete before coming to class. In addition to his
teaching responsibilities, Dr. Rolf has maintained an active research program.
Early in his career, he focused on numerical analysis; his current work is in
the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning. Recognized as an authority in technology
enhanced education, Dr. Rolf has been invited to lecture at numerous
academic institutions and conferences. Most recently, he co-authored Explorations
in Complex Analysis, a textbool with accompanying online tools for
concept exploration.<br><br>
After earning his Bachelor’s degree from Baylor University in Mathematics with
a minor in Russian, Dr. Rolf obtained a Master of Divinity degree from Southwestern
Seminary. He completed his Ph.D. at Duke University before being
appointed as an Assistant Professor at the United States Military Academy at
West Point in 1997. There, he received the Commander’s Award for Civilian
Service for outstanding achievements in faculty development and research
performance. In 2000, Dr. Rolf joined the faculty at the United States Air Force
Academy, where he initiated and coordinated implementation of technology-
based pedagogy into both introductory and advanced mathematics courses.
Dr. Rolf and his wife Ann have two children, James and Julia. In addition to
thinking about how to help undergraduates learn mathematics, he enjoys cycling,
woodworking, and gardening.
